[Intro]
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

[Verse 1]
Oh, my dear it's a pistol whip to my
Broken head and the stars are spinning
So, I pick one up and put it on my shoulder
Look, look, look
You're a world class case, I'll punch my stomach
All the people see me rolling over
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with a star like I told ya
Pace, pace, pace

[Chorus]
Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss, but being a killer
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh, oh

[Intro]
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

[Verse 2]
Shadow soar and breathing heavy
I fall four flights up, halfway steady
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with a star like I told ya
Look, look, look
I'ma take ten steps and close my eyes
Turn around and draw to my surprise
I clutch my heart and scream yeehoo!
Pace, pace, pace

[Chorus]
Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss, but being a killer
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I don't want to hear the words leave your lips
Love's lyrics leave you missing life
Tell yourself a lie and look through the cross-hair
Tie that blindfold tight
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot to learn, lot to learn, whoa
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot to learn, lot to learn whoa
I don't want to hear you say you believe when you don't

[Chorus 2x]
Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss, but being a killer
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh, oh
