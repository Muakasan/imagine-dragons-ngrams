[Verse 1]
Don't cry mother dear, your boy has left you for a couple of years
He's packed his bags, packed in his courage
Put away his fears and stepped into the unknown
And postponed all complications, yeah
A kiss goodbye and an upset stomach sends me on my way
What I believe, it gets me by, it gets me through the days
Tears fall and puddles form and days without an end
Determination never building, the war has just begun

[Chorus]
And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast, fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men come home
Oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms

[Verse 2]
1, 2, 3, 4, take the lead and I'll follow you
You're the man with the plan, I'm the pawn in your hand
Piece to be played, sacrificed to be made
It's my fate in your hands
With my brothers by my side, form a line, shoulders tight
[?] the left, right
If one man falls, they don't move 'til he's up
A one man unit at the wrist, our handcuff
It's handcuff

[Chorus]
And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast, fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men come home
Oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms
Oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms

[Chorus]
And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast, fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men go home
