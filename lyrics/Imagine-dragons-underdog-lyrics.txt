[Verse 1]
Early morning, take me over
Father, father, father
Take me to the top, oh-oh, oh-oh

Early morning, wake me up
Father, father, father
This is not enough, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh!

[Chorus]
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog

Hey!
The underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!

[Verse 2]
Early evening settle down
Father, father, father
Who am I to blame? Oh-oh, oh-oh
Early evening hush me over
Father, father, father
Are we just the same? Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh!

[Chorus]
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog

Hey!
The underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!

[Bridge]
Living the low life
Low life, low life
Living the low life
La, la, la-la la...

Low life, low life
La, la, la-la la...

Living the low life...

[Chorus]
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog

Hey!
The underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!
