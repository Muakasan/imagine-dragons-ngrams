[Verse 1]
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Verse 2]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, whoa

[Refrain]
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

[Bridge]
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
