[Verse 1]
Emma stood in front of me
Telling me what I'm supposed to be
Jackie loves to run and hide
Give her love, and she will die

Good golly me, oh my, oh my
Cross my heart and hope to die
Bourbon streets and bicycles
Holding you in carnivals

[Chorus]
Baby is my love too old for you?
Baby is my love too old for you?
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you

[Verse 2]
Dinner bells and loaded gun
Innocence is bound to run
Enemies are playing from
But don't you touch that golden sun
Innocence and sentiment
Is owned by hope it's where you're at

[Chorus]
Baby is my love too old for you?
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you

[Bridge]
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, Emma I'm for you

[Outro]
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
