If I was you, I'd run away
Closing my eyes, and count to ten
Bird in the sky, [?] in the night
[?]
So many voices
So many voices
[?], upon my eyes
Where would I turn? What would I burn?
I am a pawn within your hands

I am a pawn within your hands
So many noises

So many voices, so many choices
What do I do? Where do I turn?
Even my screams cease to be heard
Lesser of two, even you lose
Boy, you are bound to be alone
So many voices
There's so many noises
So many voices

Leavin' my youth, leavin' my truth
Caught in my blood into the stone
Lesser of two, either you lose
Or you come out and be alone
So many voices
There's so many choices
So many voices

So many voices, so many choices
What do I do? Where do I turn?
Even my screams cease to be heard
Lesser of two, even you lose
Boy, you are bound to be alone
So many voices
There's so many noises
So many voices

Leavin' my youth, leavin' my truth
Caught in my blood into the stone
Lesser of two, either you lose
Or you come out and be alone
So many voices
There's so many choices
So many voices
