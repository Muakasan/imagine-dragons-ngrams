[Verse 1]
Oh quiet down, I've had enough
I guess it's now or never
I've been around, I've settled up
I'll bolt soon or later

[Pre-Chorus]
I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

[Chorus]
So pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I've got no faith and oh did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

[Verse 2]
I'll pack it up, and hit the road
And only take my lighter
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

[Chorus]
So pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I've got no faith and oh did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
[Bridge]
Maybe you can save my soul
From all the things that I don't know

[Bridge]
Maybe you can save my soul
From all the things that I don't know

[Chorus]
So pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I've got no faith and oh did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
