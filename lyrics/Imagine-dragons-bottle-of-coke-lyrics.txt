[Verse 1]
Oh let's take it slow, I'm just a little too bold
I'm growing older than my age
I can't believe, I can't believe that
You've been on my mind
Oh, call it like you see it, I'm a little too early
Let it be, I'm just a puddle of mud
Staining everything
I see that walks all over me

[Chorus]
I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

[Verse 2]
Wise man say I'm foolish, I just give him all a grin
Though eyes are prudent, never walking on a limb
I live on stars that burn so bright they close their eyes
Typically I wake when I'm a little bit nervous
Oh, you think I'm such a competent fool
I'm telling everyone I know I'm strobing streets

[Chorus]
I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

[Bridge]
I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was golden, I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
When I need to be

[Chorus]
I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe
I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

[Bridge]
I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was golden, I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
When I need to be

[Outro]
I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was golden, I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
