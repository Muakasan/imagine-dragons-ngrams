[Verse 1]
There's so much on my mind
I don't know where to start
There's that light in your eye filling up the dark
Though I lost myself
I know it's not the end
You're my shooting star
You make my heart ascend

[Chorus]
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate

[Verse 2]
I know that we're far from where we need to be
But the world wasn't made in just one day
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong
You're my shooting star
We're flying high above

[Chorus]
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate

[Bridge]
When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith
I don't know where to turn
To bend my mind as the silver gate
You lead me on my way

[Chorus]
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate
