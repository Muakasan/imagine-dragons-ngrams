[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should have
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know

[Refrain]
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
Everything keeps crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
I'm ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm destined to be distraught
Always a reason, breaking me down to my
Knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light, oh-oh-oh

[Refrain]
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
Everything keeps crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know
Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
Everything keeps crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
I'm ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

[Bridge]
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
Who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
Who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
Who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
Who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
Who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
(Do you know? Do you know?)
Who helped me see
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
You were the one, you were the one
(Everything comes crashing down)
Oh, you gave it all to me
(You're all I know, you're all I know)

[Outro]
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
