[Verse 1]
You give me love
But then you take it away
And I’m left to search [?]
You give me love (love), love (love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

[Pre-Chorus]
I think I’m cursed
I think I’m dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (love), love (love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

[Chorus]
Take, take, take!
But don’t give it back now
Wait, wait, wait!
I’ve loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang!
[?]
Hey, hey, hey! [?]
[?]

[Verse 2]
You give me angst
Oh all I need is a break
From your clever little lies
You give me love (love), love (love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

[Pre-Chorus]
I think I’m cursed
I think I’m dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (love), love (love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

[Chorus]
Take, take, take!
But don’t give it back now
Wait, wait, wait!
I’ve loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang!
[?]
Hey, hey, hey! [?]

[Bridge]
It’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin, it’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin
Ah, ah, ah
It’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin, it’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin
It’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin, it’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin!
It’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin, it’s 2 A.M. in the city of sin!

[Chorus]
Take, take, take!
But don’t give it back now
Wait, wait, wait!
I’ve loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang!
[?]
Hey, hey, hey! [?]
