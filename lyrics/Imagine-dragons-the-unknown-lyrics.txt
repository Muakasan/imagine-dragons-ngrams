[Verse 1]
Woman help me, you turn my head in circles
Mama blessed me with magnet eyes for purple
Oh so let me show you something good
Pastor, preacher, I want to say I'm sorry
Nice to meet you, I think my eyes are starry
Pledge allegiance to my only

[Chorus]
Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me
To me, to me

[Verse 2]
Auntie Mara, I think you know my reasons
I was a product of everything in season
Oh so heavy, set me free again
Oh my papa, if all the world could know you
You could stop a thousand wars across the globe
Oh I miss you, show them something good

[Chorus]
Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me
To me, to me

[Outro]
To me, to me
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
