[Verse 1]
Its a, a strange thing
Just a miracle dream
To be at peace with a fling
What if I more than crushes?
And move passed more than just lust
To feel it deep inside
Crying out my trust...?

[Verse 2]
It's undescribibly pushin it
My mind is uncertainty
Beside I want a love that's all certain
Beyond a doubt I want to shout it out
I will shout it out to the world!

[Pre-Chorus 1]
To find a woman with certainty
Being my whole life earnin'
But, my baby, what's burnin'? Discernin' it comes from the heart
That the mind of the eyes
A dark curtain containin'
Capable commissions of hearts

[Chorus]
Here we go (Here we go)
You and I (You and I)
I am me (I am me)
And you are mine (You are me)
I'mma sing it out (Sing it out)
And play it loud
At the curtain call
Baby, take a bow, woah
Who knew what (Who knew what)
We all want (We all want)
Is just a simple situation? (Just a simple situation)
I'mma follow my heart (I will follow)
It's led me well (It has led me)
Well, I'm here with you, today

[Verse 3]
When I first met you, (ooh)
I was so short of breath
I stared like a child who (ooh)
Who was faking as deaf
You smiled and I laughed (ooh)
And you asked me some questions
But baby, all I kept thinkin
Was taking first kissin' lessons (first kissin' lessons)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Blessings seem to be pourin' (ah)
From right at the start
You searched deep down inside and know to follow your heart (ah)
I followed this path (ah)
It's leading to you
I've arrived at the 'X,' baby, tell me what to do (tell me what to do)

[Chorus]
Here we go (Here we go)
You and I (You and I)
I am me (I am me)
And you are mine (You are me)
I'mma sing it out (Sing it out)
And play it loud
At the curtain call
Baby, take a bow, woah
Who knew what (Who knew what)
We all want (We all want)
Is just a simple situation? (Just a simple situation)
I'mma follow my heart (I will follow)
It's led me well (It has led me)
Well, I'm here with you, today

[Bridge]
What does it mean to be a perfect match? (ooh)
I love, I love to be so far from perfect
What does it mean to be a perfect catch? (ooh)
I love, I love, I love to love you lady; never, ever leave me
Believe me (ooh)
I can see we'll be the small seed that grows into the stars
(ooh) It's a capable collision of hearts, yeah

[Chorus]
Here we go (Here we go)
You and I (You and I)
I am me (I am me)
And you are mine (You are me)
I'mma sing it out (Sing it out)
And play it loud
At the curtain call
Baby, take a bow, woah
Who knew what (Who knew what)
We all want (We all want)
Is just a simple situation? (Just a simple situation)
I'mma follow my heart (I will follow)
It's led me well (It has led me)
Well, I'm here with you, today
