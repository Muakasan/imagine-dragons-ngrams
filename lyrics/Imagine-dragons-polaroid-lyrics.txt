[Verse 1]
I'm a reckless mistake
I'm a cold night's intake
I'm a one night too long
I'm a come on too strong

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Verse 2]
I'm a hold my cards close
I'm a wreck what I love most
I'm a first class letdown
I'm a "shut up, sit down"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I am a headcase
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving, and
You are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, How did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in a picture
(But) never can fill the void

[Verse 3]
I'm a midnight talker
I'm an alley walker
I'm a day late two-face
I'm a burn out quick pace

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the opera
Always on time and in tune
And I am the color of boom

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, How did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in a picture
(But) never can fill the void

[Bridge]
I'm gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

[Chorus]
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, How did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in a picture
(But) never can fill the void

[Outro]
Oh, love is a polaroid
Oh, love is a polaroid (oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh, oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh)
Oh, love is a polaroid (oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh)
Love is a polaroid
