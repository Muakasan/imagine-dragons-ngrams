[Verse 1]
(Hey) I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Heater's gone and money's tight
In this little home that I'm living in

[Refrain]
You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh
What is with you?
Oh oh oh
I've never seen this side of you
Hey
Oh oh oh
What is with you?
Oh oh oh
I've never seen this side of you
Hey

[Chorus]
We are all living, till we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

[Verse 2]
I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

[Refrain]
You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh
What is with you?
Oh oh oh
I've never seen this side of you
Hey
Oh oh oh
What is with you?
Oh oh oh
I've never seen this side of you
Hey

[Chorus]
We are all living, till we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling


[Bridge]
(Go on and be brave)
(Go on and be brave)

[Chorus]
We are all living, 'til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

[Outro]
(Till we're older....)
(Go on and be brave)
