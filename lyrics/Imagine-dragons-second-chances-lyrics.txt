[Verse 1]
Older than water, stubborn as stone
There'll be no forgiveness for all that you've known
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy
Hotter than friction, subtle as sound
There'll be no forgiveness when you come around
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy

[Pre-Chorus]
I get older and life fades
But you remain

[Chorus]
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

[Verse 2]
Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it, then I can atone
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
I get older and life fades
But you remain
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

[Bridge]
Forgive me
Forgive me

[Chorus]
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances
