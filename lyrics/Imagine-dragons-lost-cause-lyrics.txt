[Chorus]
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Because I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

[Verse 1]
Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay
The kiss of death will have to wait
My head, is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it, the mist of darkness
In my head

[Chorus]
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Because I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

[Verse 2]
Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound
Oh we, can make it, out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end
As long, as you, are with me, friend

[Chorus]
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Because I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

[Bridge]
No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow
Because you are all I am

[Chorus]
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Because I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
