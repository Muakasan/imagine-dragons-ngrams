[Verse 1]
Always be careful, don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T?
Kiss, lights, big news
It's open places, question rose
Stop tryin', you vagabond
What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else

[Chorus]
So come boots, oh walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wait, explain you're zippin' off
Don't let it off so easy
What did you mean?
Always be careful, don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T?
Kiss, lights, big news
It's open places, question rose
Stop tryin', you vagabond
What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else

[Chorus]
So come boots, oh walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream

[Bridge]
Oh I don't want to see your face in this broken town
(Oh I don't want to see your face in this broken town)
I'm runnin' down South to bury my head in the ground
(Runnin' down South, bury my head in the ground)

Oh, I don't need money and I don't need you
But if you come around I gotta think of you home

[Chorus]
Boots, oh walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream
