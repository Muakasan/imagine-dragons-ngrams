[Verse 1]
Did your mother like your Sunday dress?
Astrology or etiquette?
So what, so what?

[Chorus]
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

[Verse 2]
I'm not a lover let me be
For our hearts to find or be set free
So what, so what?
I'd show you, you'd show me
I'd show you, you'd show me
I'd show you, so much, so much

[Chorus]
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

[Bridge]
Your blood, it flows in from the western sea
Your eyes, they shine in through this shaded tree
Oh, I believe in you
These places, they have changed
I don't know anything, but you know me
Oh, you know me

[Chorus]
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

[Outro]
Oh, not at all
