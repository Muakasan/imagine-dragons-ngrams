[Verse 1]
Run for cover
My sense of fear is running thin
Undercover
Just like a candle in the wind

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming

[Chorus]
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen[x2]
Now we're just going to ride it out

[Verse 2]
Every morning
I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh, good morning
Will you just wait until I die?

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming

[Chorus][x2]
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just going to ride it out

[Outro]
I just want to take it in
Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again?
We are fallen
