[Verse 1]
Broken homes, fighting brothers
Drugs sold upon the streets
Terrorism and alcoholism
The selfish motives guide the world
We've been mothers, woah, crying fathers
What has this world come to?

[Chorus]
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing?
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?

[Post-Chorus]
Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Singing to the people
Let's live until we die

[Verse 2]
Grew up for business
I'll do whatever it takes
Don't work a day unless you're paid
One night stands and broken hearts
We forgot how to love
I shoot 'em up and take 'em down
I don't bleed on my ground

[Chorus]
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing?
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?

[Post-Chorus]
Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Singing to the people
Let's live until we die
Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Singing to the people
Let's live until we die
