[Verse 1]
Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Because thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

[Chorus]
Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over

[Chorus]
Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
