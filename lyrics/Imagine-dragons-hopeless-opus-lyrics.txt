[Verse 1]
Hey, Mr. Cage Man
Let me get a fresh breath
Cherry bomb, head strong
I can fake my own death
Hey, Mr. Fate Man
Shuffle me a ninth life
I've been wrong, go along
Throwin' me a sharp right

[Refrain]
It's not a picture perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

[Chorus]
I've got this place that
I've filled with empty space, so
I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place, so
I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

[Verse 2]
Hey, Mr. Safe Man
Hustle me an okay
I could slide, take a dive
Take it for the home team
Hey, Mr. Post Man
Slip me one more green note
I've been low, hit the floor
Looking just to make broke

[Refrain]
It's not a picture perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

[Chorus]
I've got this place that
I've filled with empty space, so
I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place, so
I'm trying not face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

[Bridge]
Hey mister c-, Hey, hey mister, hey Mr. Cage Man
Cherry bomb
Let me ch-ch-ch cherry bomb
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch cherry bomb

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I've got this place that
I've filled with empty space, so
I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place, so
I'm trying not face what's become of me
My hopeless opus
