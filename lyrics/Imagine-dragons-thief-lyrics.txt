[Verse 1]
If only you, you could see the darkest place that you could be
Oh maybe then you'd understand
From desert heat to car-filled streets, from broken home to the city beat
There's so much more than you could know

[Chorus]
So take me back when I believe
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
All the heights that I could reach
Back when I wasn't afraid, just like a thief

[Verse 2]
If I could live a thousand times, if I could make a thousand tries
Oh maybe then I'd get it right
The more I see, the more I know that everyone just wants to show
No we don't want to see the truth

[Chorus]
So take me back when I believe
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
All the heights that I could reach
Back when I wasn't afraid, just like a thief

[Bridge]
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?

[Chorus]
So take me back when I believe
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
All the heights that I could reach
Back when I wasn't afraid, just like a thief
