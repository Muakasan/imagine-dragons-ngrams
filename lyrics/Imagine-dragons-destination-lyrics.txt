[Verse 1]
I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sin and those are cunningly estranging, oh
I think a little about a lot and reach a verdict
You think a lot about a little never hurt at all of our energy
Bring these words to life

[Chorus]
We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

[Verse 2]
I take me back to '91
I had the love life there, a loaded gun alright
I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sin and those are leaving but are changing
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

[Chorus]
We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
