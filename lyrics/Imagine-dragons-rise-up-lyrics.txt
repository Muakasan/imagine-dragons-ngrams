[Verse 1]
I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
I've been shaken, waking in the night light
I've been breaking, hiding from the spotlight
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

[Verse 2]
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been living, but I was never breathing
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

[Bridge]
I'm bursting like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

[Outro]
(Rise, rise up)
(Rise, rise up)
