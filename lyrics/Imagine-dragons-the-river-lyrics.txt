[Verse 1]
In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You got to get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You got to get up

[Chorus]
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

[Verse 2]
I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself

[Chorus]
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

[Bridge]
Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
(Love only comes when I give it up)
(Love only comes when I give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love only comes when I give it up)
(Love only comes when I give it up)
For anyone but myself
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
(Love only comes when I give it up)
(Love only comes when I give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love only comes when I give it up)
(Love only comes when I give it up)
