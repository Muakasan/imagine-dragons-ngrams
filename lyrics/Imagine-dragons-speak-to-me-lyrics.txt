[Verse 1]
Draw a room of flashing lights and let all whispers die
Sixteen colors, I'm so lonely
Let, let the pictures dry

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody sees things differently
And everybody says things rationally
So, open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So, open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

[Verse 2]
Suppressed emotions flying past
And heading out the other end
Our precious love, the daily grind
It's wonderful
Elastic wasted, rubber ghost
Are floating past the midnight hour
They push aside the things that matter most
Wonderful

Trace the faces, X the places where the judges lay
I'm not scared of all the nothings
Let, let the whispers die

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody sees things differently
(Exciting news at discount price)
And everybody says things rationally
(A million opportunities)
So, open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So, open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

[Bridge]
I-M-A-G-I-N-E, oh
M-O-V-E-M-E-N-T, oh
I-M-A-G-I-N-E, oh
L-E-T-U-S-B-E-F-E-A-R-L-E-S-S

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody sees things differently
(Exciting news at discount price)
And everybody says things rationally
(A million opportunities)
So, open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So, open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
(Wonderful)
