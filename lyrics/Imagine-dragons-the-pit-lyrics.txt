[Intro]
I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun
It shines, it shines on you
It lights up your eyes

[Verse 1]
Sitting here all by ourselves
Counting all the people
They ask us why
Gather all around
And stare on down
Into a dark, dark pit
Don't go, please don't go
They step on in, oh they fall all in
They walk all over you
One step at a time, they were walking a line
Down the false, false hope

[Pre-Chorus]
I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun
It shines, it shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we hear

[Chorus]
If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, I'd fill up that pit
Whoa-oh
I'd cry 'till it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

[Bridge]
How can I, how can I convince you to stay?
Where all the flowers bloom and the grass, it sways
And the rain, it pours
And the waves all roar
And the trees they grow, and the falling crow
Soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in
Oh, you follow it in

[Pre-Chorus]
I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun
It shines, it shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we hear

[Chorus]
If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, oh I'd fill up that pit
Whoa-oh
I'd cry 'till it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand
