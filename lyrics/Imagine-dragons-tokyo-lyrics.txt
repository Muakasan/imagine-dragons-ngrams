[Verse 1]
Baby's got a lot of baggage
It doesn't seem to matter, it doesn't seem to matter
Got a ticket for the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it for the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress that was a hostess on the West-Coast
Don't you see it in my eyes tonight
Baby's got a lot of baggage

[Chorus]
Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, Pay in the palms of the rock and roll

[Verse 2]
Get that dynamite
Chick-a-Boom on the down tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight
Get that dynamite

[Chorus]
Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, Pay in the palms of the rock and roll

[Post-Chorus]
Hey! I come back to where you are
Hey! I come back to where you are
Give that dynamite

[Chorus]
Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, Pay in the palms of the rock and roll
Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, Pay in the palms of the rock and roll

[Post-Chorus]
Hey! I come back to where you are
Hey! I come back to where you are

[Outro]
Too-ookyyooo-oo-ooo
Too-ookyyooo-oo-ooo
Tokyo!
