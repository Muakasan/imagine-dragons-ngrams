[Intro]
Oh, the mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river

[Verse 1]
I wanna live a life like that
Live the life of the faithful one
Wanna bow to the floor
With everybody else wanna be someone
I wanna make some love
I don't want no enemies
Oh, it's the curse of a man
Always living life, living life, living just to please

[Chorus]
Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm alkaline
I'm always keeping to the basics
I'm overboard
I'm self-destructive
And self-important
And I'm anxious
Oh, I'm self-assured
I'm nervous
And I'm pacing, oh, I'm pacing

[Chorus]
Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river

[Bridge]
And I am going under
Oh, I am going under
I am going under
Oh, I am going under
I am going under

[Outro]
Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
M-m-m-mouth of the river
Oh, the mouth of the river
