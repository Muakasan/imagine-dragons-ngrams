[Verse 1]
Close my eyes so tight I might not realize you're gone
I tell a million stories like I'm old and she's young
It's cold out here and I, I don't mind
I feel the heat creeping up my spine, but it's alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
February seems to be the worst of all my friends
She brings in all the darkness when the year, it just begins
But oh it seems so cold at the strangest of times
Loneliness, it seems to be the worst of all her crimes
And I'm alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Don't you let me go
I'm holdin' on
I will let you know
What's going on
You're the reason why I sing this song
(Ohh)

[Chorus]
I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
