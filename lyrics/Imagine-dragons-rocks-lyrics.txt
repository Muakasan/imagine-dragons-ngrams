Where do we go from here
Where do we go from here

I threw some rocks up your at you window
I broke some rocks right through your window

Timber, Timber
We fallin down
Let the forest hear our sound

Boom ba boom ba boom
Ah ooo ah ooo

Why can't I see, what's right in front of me?

We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart
