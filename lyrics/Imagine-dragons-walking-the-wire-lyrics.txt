[Verse 1]
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around and we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

[Verse 2]
There's nights we had to just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

[Bridge]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

[Chorus]
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

[Outro]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
