[Verse 1]
I am aching, near breaking
I'm just taking my time to stand in line for a dance with you
Whoa, dance with you, oh
It may not appear, but it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here, fully pleading, near bleeding
Dying, competing for a chance with you, oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

[Verse 2]
If you stand with my heart in hand
Oh, perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So unaware of my longing stare
If all I care is to dance with you

[Chorus]
Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

[Bridge]
I freeze, I feel debris, my hands been seized
My thoughts are cut, I close my eyes shut
Knowing it's not you, but there's a chance it's you
For a dance with me

[Chorus]
Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you
