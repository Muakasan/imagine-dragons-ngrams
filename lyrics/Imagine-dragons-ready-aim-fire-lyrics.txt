[Chorus 1]
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire!)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away

[Verse 1]
Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery

How come I've never seen your face around here?
I know every single face around here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here

[Chorus 2]
We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Back in the casing, shaking and pacing
This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look through the rifle's sight
How come I've never seen your face around here?
I know every single face around here
Here in the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]
