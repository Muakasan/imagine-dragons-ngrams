[Verse 1]
It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about
A sudden attraction
Between two
With a few
Of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds
But, it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
The last to be basked in your presence
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

[Chorus]
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you
Ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

[Verse 2]
Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 3]
She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream
Feelings roll down like thunder
I never met my match
Melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble
For the first time in my life
I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand
I don't know when it's art
When I laugh she must smile
When I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

[Chorus]
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you
Ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

[Verse 2]
Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence, whoa
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Bridge]
Oh, be easy on me baby
I'm a sensitive mess
You're a beautiful girl
Nothing else, nothing less
Just tell me what you're feeling
What I know to be true
And I'll give all that I have
Baby, I'll give it all to you

[Verse 2]
Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
