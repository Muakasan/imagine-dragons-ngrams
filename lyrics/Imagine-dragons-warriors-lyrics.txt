[Verse 1]
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
To work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust

[Verse 2]
The time will come, when you will have to rise
Above the best, and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

[Chorus]
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust
