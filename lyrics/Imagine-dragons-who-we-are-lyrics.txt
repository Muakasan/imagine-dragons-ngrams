[Verse 1]
Up in the morning
Up in the evening
Picking up clocks
When the birds come back to eat, oh to eat
Up in the mountain
Down in the king's lair
Pushing these blocks
In the heat of the afternoon, oh afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

[Chorus]
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all up hill from here
Oh

[Verse 2]
Up in the attic
Down in the cellar
Lost in the static
Coming back for more
Oh for more
Out with the reason
In with the season
Taking down names
In my book of jealousy
Jealousy

[Pre-Chorus]
We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

[Chorus]
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all up hill from here
Oh

Because

[Chorus]
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all up hill from here
Oh

[Bridge]
They say we’re crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy

[Chorus]
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all up hill from here
Oh

[Chorus]
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all up hill from here
Oh

They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
