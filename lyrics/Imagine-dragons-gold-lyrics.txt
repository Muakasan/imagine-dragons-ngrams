[Verse 1]
First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

[Chorus]
When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

[Verse 2]
Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turning stale and it's cold
You'll no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

[Chorus]
When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

[Bridge]
I'm dying to feel again
Anything at all
But I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

[Chorus]
When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Gold
Gold
Gold
Thank you guys so much
