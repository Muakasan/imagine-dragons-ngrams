[Verse 1]
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They may just run away from you

You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Take it in but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

I'm on top of the world...

[Verse 2]
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Take it in, but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Video curt]

[Chorus]
I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

[Bridge]
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up and you make you round
But get up now, get up, get up now... (x2)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

[Bridge]
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up and you make you round
But get up now, get up, get up now... (x2)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

I'm on top of the world...
