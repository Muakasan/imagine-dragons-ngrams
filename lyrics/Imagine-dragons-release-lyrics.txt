[Verse 1]
Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting Sun
Heaven talks, but not to me
Cause Heaven knows that nothing good comes free

[Pre-Chorus]
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?

[Chorus]
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks, but not to me
Now I wonder if it's meant to be

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

[Bridge]
I'll take your word, cause after all
You've never lied, no not at all
But look at me, oh what a mess
And I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release

[Chorus]
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
